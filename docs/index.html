        <!-- The beginning -->
        <h2>Introduction and Myth Debunking</h2>
        <p>HTML Becon is scary and little is known about it. Because of this, many legends have started around it from within the interwebs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They say it's real, but HTML cannot be becon so they're wrong.</li>
            <li>They say it's greasy, but HTML has no elbow grease in it so they're wrong.</li>
            <li>They say it tastes good, despite becons being full of elbow grease, so they're wrong.</li>
            <li>They say it's alive, but becon is too weird to be sentient by modern standards, so they're wrong.</li>
            <li>They say it's mathematical because there are strange and cryptic expressions like "&lt;h2&gt;" and "&lt;ol&gt;", but becon has only grease, not numbers, in it so they're wrong.</li>
            <li>They say it grants wishes, but becon is only greasy, not wishful, so they're wrong.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Plan</h2>
        <p>This non-exhaustive and non-biased list should provide you, dear reader, with a good summary of some of the major nonsense our fellow hoomans have concocted.
            And the more nonsense there is, the more scares and spooks that follow. We as the proud species of <i>hoomu sapens</i> need to band together and concoct a <strong>plan of action</strong>.
            Fortunately, I have already concocted a mad, yet necessary, plan of action of my own that is both <strong>eco-friendly</strong> and <strong>measurable</strong>:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML becon, or <strong>Hbecon</strong>, likes hooman grease, so we must find all hoomans nearby and force them to do squats, in unison, to attract as many Hbecons as possible.</li>
            <li>Once enough Hbecons arrive, lure them all into an empty football stadium.</li>
            <li>Hbecons, unlike rumors say, are composed of (mostly) plant-matter. Upon experiencing intense heat, Hbecons decompose into compost. Ergo, light the stadium on fire and blockade the exits.</li>
            <li>Profit. A production plan for building my own compost production plant.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Visualization of Plan</h2>
        <p>It's understandable if you don't understand the greatness of this plan, since the peeple who aren't you do. However, leaving it at that is a bit too cruel to your poor mind.
            Therefore, I've prepared a handy visualization of The Plan for your viewing pleasure <i>and</i> understanding:
        </p>
        
        <img src="../images/person_and_cat_and_box.png" alt="A visualization of The Plan.
            A box symbolizes the stadium,
            a sad cat represents the resulting faces of the Hbecons after the plan completes,
            the person symbolizing our cheers of victory,
            and the door representing our new future as a species in the aftermath.
            I don't know why the person's sitting though."

        <!-- The finale -->
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We've come a long way since hoomanity came about. We've gone through many trials and tribulations, but we as a species have always survived adn persevered. However, the spooks
            and scares of the Hbecons are a threat to us all, especially to our sanities, and hoomanity as one whole needs to band together and do my plan in order to keep our minds safe.</p>
