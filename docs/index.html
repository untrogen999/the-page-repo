        <h2>Introduction and Myth Debunking</h2>
        <p>HTML Bacon is scary and little is known about it, but powerful. Because of this, many legends of the interwebs have started around it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They say it's real.</li>
            <li>They say it's greasy.</li>
            <li>They say it tastes good with elbow grease, despite elbows being full of sweat.</li>
            <li>They say it's alive, but bacon is too weird by modern standards so it cannot be alive.</li>
            <li>They say HTML is full of math because there are strange and cryptic expressions like "h2" and "&lt;p&gt;", but they don't know anything.</li>
        </ul>
